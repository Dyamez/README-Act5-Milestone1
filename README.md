# Milestone Project 1

This a a web based game made in javascript, html5 and css/bootstrap.
It is a simple game of Blackjack where the player closest to 21
wins.
Inspired to make such a card game as it was one of the first tutorial I followed learning java on my own prior to this bootcamp.

## Deployment

Github: https://dyamez.github.io/BlackJack-Milestone1/
Repository: https://github.com/Dyamez/BlackJack-Milestone1/

## Requirements

This program runs with liveserver, and is deployed on the web
via github.io.

All assets loaded when served through local host server by way of vsCode.

## Configuration

The javascript game has simple controls which includes:

-Music Toggle
located as a button on the upper right that mutes the music.
-Dealer button
deals the card
-Stay button
-New Game button

Directions are to press the 'Hit Me!' button to start the game. The 'Hit Me!' button is to deal cards for the player, which just continues even after results are given. 'Stay' button reveals the dealers hand. 'new game' button refreshes the page to set up a fresh round. 'mute/unmute' button on the upper top right for sound.

## FAQ

-Implemented are mostly learned form the JS course here on Class10 such as declarations, functions, refactoring etc... otherwise citations are made from other sources.

-Variables/codes have been written in 'Filipino' words which i found to aid me in further learning coding in general. Rough translation provided at 'assets/translation.txt' if needed.

-I had cited some references that gave me an idea of how to properly construct some codes as problems arose.

-Looked as intended on a 1440 monitor. Resolution below it might be better when out-zoomed. - audio music (mp3) won't play on safari ios or android chrome browser served from javascript due to its limitations.

-No issue on chrome or edge on windows. Not tested on Mac.
Music would load on page but could take several seconds. Music must be manually allowed on certain browsers like firefox on the page settings for it to play.

-Background photo used in this project is mine and was taken with my phone. 'ðŸ˜‰'
